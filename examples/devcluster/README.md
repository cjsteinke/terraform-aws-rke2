# Terraform AWS RKE2 Cluster

This example is a use case for the module, it is verified by Terratest in the ./tests directory (devcluster_test.go).
You can run this test by navigating to the ./tests directory and running `go test -v -parallel=10 -timeout=30m -run=TestDevCluster`.
The cluster generated by this example should not be considered production ready or scalable, it is a single step beyond a single dev server.

This example will provision a 3 node cluster where each node is both a server and an agent.
This means it will be a control plane and run workloads.

This example uses the "rpm" install method, and assumes that the servers can access the public internet.
The security group that is generated in this example allows servers to communicate if they are in the same VPC, and allows servers to initiate connections to external sources.
It doesn't allow outside clients to initiate connections with the servers, with the exception of the server running this module (aka the "runner").
