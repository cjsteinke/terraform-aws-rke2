# Terraform AWS RKE2 Dedicated Cluster

In this example we are generating an RKE2 cluster of nodes on AWS where some nodes are dedicated to the control plane and others are workers.
As with most examples we are using SLES 15 and as simple a configuration as possible.

This example is a use case for the module, it is verified by Terratest in the ./tests directory (test_dedicated_cluster.go).
You can run this test by navigating to the ./tests directory and running `go test -v -parallel=10 -timeout=30m -run TestDedicatedCluster`.
The cluster generated by this example should not be considered production ready, it is a step beyond the Dev cluster.
