# Terraform AWS RKE2 Cluster

This example is a use case for the module, it is verified by Terratest in the ./tests directory (dedicatedcluster_test.go).
You can run this test by navigating to the ./tests directory and running `go test -v -parallel=10 -timeout=30m -run=TestDedicatedCluster`.
The cluster generated by this example has some roles spit out, but may not work for your specific needs,
it builds on the "devcluster" example but splits the cluster into 3 servers and 3 agents.

Servers in this example are control plane nodes, and agents are workers.
